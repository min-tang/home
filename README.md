I am currently a faculty member at the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, China - a place I consider home, having received my B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. here in 1994, 1996, and 1999, respectively. 
I've been fortunate enough to broaden my perspectives through opportunities as a visiting scholar, first at Wichita State University from June 2003 to May 2004 and later at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, from April 2007 to April 2008 and again from September 2016 to April 2017. 
My inquisitive nature has led me to delve into diverse topics like solid modeling, collision detection/handling, cloth simulation, and GPU-based computation acceleration. My curiosity and persistent endeavors have resulted in contributing over 90 papers to various journals and conferences. Some of these include platforms like SIGGRAPH and SIGGRAPH Asia, and journals like ACM Transaction on Graphics and IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, to name a few.
In my commitment to the field of computer science, I humbly partake as a senior member of the CCF while also maintaining active membership with the ACM and the IEEE.

I have served as a reviewer for many international conferences (SIGGRAPH, SIGGRPAH Asia, I3D, HPG, WSCG, ICRA, AAAI, etc.) and journals (ACM Transaction on Graphics, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on Haptics, The Visual Computer, etc.) and served as:
- Technical Paper Committee Member of SIGGRAPH Asia 2023,
- Program Committee Member of CVM 2024, CVM 2025,
- Program Committee Member of CGI 2023, CGI 2024, CGI 2025,
- Program Committee Member of CASA 2022,  AniNex 2023 Workshop at CASA 2023, CASA2024, 
- Program Committee Member of AAAI-2021,
- Program Committee Member of Pacific Graphics 2021, 2020, 2022, 2024, 2025,
- Program Committee Member of Chinagraph 2014, 2016, 2020, 2022, 2024ï¼Œ
- Program Committee Member of ChinaVR 2016, 2021, 2024, 
- Program Committee Member of I3D 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 
- Program Committee Member of Eurographics 2016,
- International Program Committee Member of EGSR 2017, 2018, 2019,
- Program Committee Member of China CAD&CG 2017, China CAD&CG 2018-GDC 2018, China GDC 2019 - CAD&CG 2019, China CAD/Graphics 2021, China CAD&CG 2023, China CAD&CG 2024, CCF CAD/CG 2025,
- International Program Committee Member of SCA 2019, 2023, 2024,
- Board of Reviewers Member of WSCG 2012, 2013, 2014,
